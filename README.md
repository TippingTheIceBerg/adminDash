Project is plan to mostly use grid instead of flex, while flex can be used, grid is able to do everything flex can do. Best practice will be to use only that and improve.

CSS 
1. The design is composed of three distinct section, the 1. sidebar 2. the top nav 3. the body which contains the content.
2. The sidebar seems like a simple take up the full height of the view height. 
3.The top nav and the content area share the same width, so they may be sharing a container.
